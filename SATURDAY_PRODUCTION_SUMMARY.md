---

## 🎲 SAME GAME PARLAY ANALYSIS

### Results
**No profitable SGP combinations found** after correlation analysis.

**Why No SGPs?**

The correlation analyzer examined all possible combinations and found:

1. **Teammate Props**: Negative correlations reduce parlay value
   - Example: LeBron points + AD points = -0.20 correlation
   - Limited possessions mean if one scores more, other scores less

2. **Same Player Props**: Often overpriced by bookmakers
   - Example: LeBron points + assists + rebounds
   - Bookmakers already price in playing time correlation

3. **Opponent Props**: Positive correlations already in odds
   - Example: Curry points + LaMelo points
   - Books account for high-pace game scenarios

**This is Actually Good News**:
- Shows the reality checks are working
- Better to pass than bet -EV SGPs
- Individual props offer better value

## 🎓 LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES

### What to Watch For

**In Game Analysis**:

1. **Knicks/Suns Game**:
   - Watch pace in first quarter
   - If scoring <50 total in Q1, under looking good
   - If pace fast, may need to hedge

2. **Chet Holmgren**:
   - Monitor first half minutes
   - If getting 15+ min in first half, over is solid
   - Watch for foul trouble

3. **LeBron Rebounds**:
   - Check if Lakers getting blown out (more rebounds for LeBron)
   - Watch if AD is dominating boards (less for LeBron)

### Post-Game Analysis

After all games finish:

1. **Calculate actual win rate**
2. **Compare to model predictions**
3. **Identify any patterns**:
   - Did all unders hit? (Market mispricing totals)
   - Did props outperform spreads?
   - Were home teams better than expected?

4. **Update strategy** based on results
