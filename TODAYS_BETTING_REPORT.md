## 💰 MONEYLINE ANALYSIS

### Summary
**0 Positive EV Opportunities Found**

The Elo model detected several apparent edges, but all were **rejected by the reality check system** due to:
- Edges too large for NBA markets (>15%)
- NBA markets are highly efficient (85-95%)
- Model may be missing key information

### Notable Model vs Market Discrepancies

❌ **Memphis Grizzlies +132** - Edge: +20.9%
- Model: 64.0% | Market: 43.1%
- **REJECTED:** Edge too large, likely model error

❌ **Lakers +106** - Edge: +15.5%
- Model: 64.0% | Market: 48.5%
- **REJECTED:** Unrealistic edge for competitive game

❌ **Pelicans +570** - Edge: +21.1%
- Model: 36.0% | Market: 14.9%
- **REJECTED:** Model doesn't account for Pelicans injuries/roster issues

❌ **Nuggets -116** - Edge: +10.3%
- Model: 64.0% | Market: 53.7%
- **REJECTED:** Marginally over threshold, needs verification

**🎯 RECOMMENDATION:**
**PASS** on all moneyline bets today. Model showing unrealistic edges indicating calibration issues or missing information. Wait for more data.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### Data Quality
- NBA API experiencing intermittent issues
- Many players falling back to demo data generation
- Manual roster updates working perfectly (Luka on Lakers, AD on Mavs)

### Model Limitations
- **Moneyline edges appear inflated** - likely model calibration issue
- All moneyline bets rejected by reality check
- Player props using conservative estimates (30% std dev)
- SGP correlations not fully modeled

### Injury Concerns
- Check latest injury reports before betting
- Verified from manual updates:
  - ✓ Jayson Tatum OUT (ankle)
  - ✓ Kyrie Irving OUT (knee)
  - ✓ Luka Doncic ON LAKERS (traded)
  - ✓ Anthony Davis ON MAVERICKS (traded)

**2. Rockets vs Pelicans 2Q OVER** - $150

### What to Watch

🔍 **Before Betting:**
1. Check FanDuel SGP builder for actual parlay odds
2. Only bet if odds are within 100 points of fair odds
3. Verify no late scratches/injuries
4. Check starting lineups 30 min before tipoff

🔍 **During Games:**
1. Monitor 1Q pace for 2Q bet adjustments
2. If game becomes blowout, avoid all 2H bets

## 📊 SYSTEM PERFORMANCE NOTES

### What Worked
✅ Manual roster updates (Luka, AD trades tracked)
✅ Hybrid data system (NBA API + Sportradar + Manual)
✅ Market efficiency reality checks (rejected bad bets)
✅ SGP probability calculations
✅ Quarter betting analysis framework

### What Needs Improvement
⚠️ Elo model calibration (showing inflated edges)
⚠️ NBA API connection (intermittent failures)
⚠️ Player prop lines (using generic 25/8/7 instead of real lines)
⚠️ SGP correlation modeling (independent prob assumptions)

- Never bet more than you can afford to lose
- These are probabilities, not guarantees
- Even 95% bets lose 5% of the time
